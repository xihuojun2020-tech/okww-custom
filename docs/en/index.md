**Personal-maintained branch: 1.84.01.** This documentation describes [xihuojun2020-tech/okww-custom](https://github.com/xihuojun2020-tech/okww-custom), which is separate from the [upstream project](https://github.com/ok-oldking/ok-wuthering-waves). Download this branch only from [its releases page](https://github.com/xihuojun2020-tech/okww-custom/releases); upstream releases are maintained separately.

This version recognizes Sea of Ruins floors 7–11 when started from an already open floor detail page and challenges up to floor 11. The 1.84.01 floor 11 recognition fix has offline regression coverage; a complete live 7–11 run has not been verified. Resonant Sonic Simulation is combat-only after the player manually enters and navigates the activity. Account to-do items are for display and manual tracking; they are separate from completion checks and do not start tasks. See the [changelog](https://github.com/xihuojun2020-tech/okww-custom/blob/v1.84.01/更新日志.md) and [feature documentation](../references/sea-ruins.md).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This software is an external auxiliary tool designed to automate parts of the Wuthering Waves gameplay. It interacts with the game solely by simulating standard user interface actions, in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. This project aims to simplify repetitive user tasks and does not disrupt game balance or provide an unfair advantage. It will never modify any game files or data.

This software is open-source and free, intended for personal learning and communication purposes only. Do not use it for any commercial or profit-making activities. The development team reserves the right of final interpretation. Any issues arising from the use of this software are not the responsibility of this project or its developers.

Please note, according to Kuro Games' official Fair Play Declaration for Wuthering Waves:
> The use of any third-party tools to disrupt the game experience is strictly prohibited.
> We will take strict measures against the use of unauthorized tools such as cheats, speed hacks, cheat software, and macro scripts. This includes, but is not limited to, automated farming, skill acceleration, god mode, teleportation, and modification of game data.
> Once verified, we will impose penalties based on the severity and frequency of the violation, including but not limited to deducting illicit gains, and suspending or permanently banning the game account.

**By using this software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the above statement, and you voluntarily assume all potential risks.**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please check the following steps one by one before asking for help:

1.  **Antivirus Software**: Add the software's installation directory to the **exceptions or whitelist** of your antivirus software (including Windows Defender) to prevent files from being mistakenly deleted or blocked.
2.  **Display Settings**:
    *   In-game filters can generally be enabled, but graphics driver filters such as NVIDIA RTX Dynamic Vibrance and AMD sharpening must be disabled.
    *   Use the game's default brightness settings.
    *   Disable any overlays that display information on the game screen (e.g., frame rates from MSI Afterburner, Fraps, etc.).
3.  **Custom Keybinds**: If you have changed the default in-game keybinds, you must update them accordingly in the `ok-ww` settings. Only the keybinds listed in the settings are supported.
4.  **Software Version**: Check and ensure you are using the latest version of `ok-ww`.
5.  **Game Performance**: Make sure the game can run stably at **60 FPS**. If the frame rate is unstable, try lowering the game's graphics quality or resolution.
6.  **Game Disconnections**: Enable "Close Launcher After Start" in the `ok-ww` settings and make sure the launcher process is not running, or run `ok-ww` from source.
7.  **OpenVINO Error**: If you encounter error `0x000005` on an Intel CPU with an NPU, update to the latest Intel NPU driver.
8.  **Getting Help**: If the steps above do not solve your problem, please submit a detailed bug report through our community channels.
9.  **Disable Auto Sprint**: Turn off Auto Sprint in the game settings.
10. **Equip a Main Echo on Every Character**: Every character in the team must have a main Echo equipped (the Echo Skill icon should appear in the bottom-right corner). If any character does not have one, Auto Combat will not function correctly and may repeatedly lock onto enemies without attacking.
